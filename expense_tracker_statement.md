# **Project Statement: Personal Expense Tracker**

## **1. Project Title**
**Personal Expense Tracker using Python**

## **2. Introduction**
The Personal Expense Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently. It stores expense records in a CSV file, making data persistent and easy to manage. The program allows users to add expenses, view recorded expenses, and calculate total expenditure.

## **3. Objective of the Project**
- To provide a simple tool for maintaining personal financial records.
- To help users track their spending habits.
- To demonstrate the use of Python file handling, CSV operations, classes, and user input.

## **4. Project Description**
This program allows users to:
- Add expenses with date, category, amount, and description.
- View all recorded expenses in a tabular format.
- Calculate and display the total amount spent.
- Automatically save expenses in a CSV file for later access.

The project uses Python's **csv** and **os** modules to handle data storage and retrieval. All expenses are saved in `expenses.csv`, ensuring persistence.

## **5. Features**
- **CSV-Based Storage**: Stores expenses permanently.
- **Data Validation**: Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric amounts).
- **Tabular Display**: Shows all expenses neatly formatted.
- **Automatic Loading**: Reads previous data on startup.

## **6. Technologies Used**
- **Python 3**
- **CSV File Handling**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## **7. Conclusion**
The Personal Expense Tracker is a useful and beginner-friendly project that demonstrates practical use of Python for real-world applications. It promotes financial awareness and enhances programming concepts like file operations, loops, error handling, and class-based structure.

## **8. Future Enhancements**
- Add income tracking.
- Introduce category-wise expenditure reports.
- Implement data visualization (graphs).
- Create a GUI version using Tkinter.
- Add monthly budget features.
